These are sample Python scripts used to process CalTPA data.

We start with raw .asc files containing sample, non-real data.

- The notebook "caltpa_single_file.ipynb" is a good example of processing a single CalTPA file.
- The notebook "caltpa_multiple_files.ipynb" combines multiple files into one .csv file, then cleans the data.

How to use this notebook?
- You can run each cell separately.
- Some cells will have output, some will not.
- df.head() statements are used to display the DataFrame for you to inspect.
